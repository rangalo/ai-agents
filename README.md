# AI Agents

This repository contains two sub-projects, each exploring a different approach to building AI agents.

## Sub-projects

### `first-agent`

This project is a research assistant agent built with LangChain and OpenAI. It can use tools like DuckDuckGo Search and Wikipedia to answer user queries and save the research output to a file.

### `agent-without-framework`

This project is a conversational AI agent that can read, list, and edit files on your local system. It is built from scratch in Python without using any external frameworks like LangChain or LlamaIndex. This project is intended to be a learning exercise for understanding the core concepts of building AI agents.
